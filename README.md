## Overview
This project is a comprehensive analysis of stock market data for three major companies: Amazon (AMZN), IBM (IBM), and Microsoft (MSFT). The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and time series analysis using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The goal is to gain insights into the stock performance of these companies over time and to visualize trends using candlestick charts.
